# AceyDeucey

Perl implementation of the card game 'Acey Deucey'.

Somewhat inspired by Dave Taylor's "Work the Shell" columns
in the Feb/Mar(&Apr?) 2015 issues of Linux Journal.

Not really intended for public consumption - mostly just for
my own amusement... but if you find anything interesting, 
have at it!! :-)
