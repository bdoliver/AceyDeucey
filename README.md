# AceyDeucey

Perl implementation of the card game 'Acey Deucey'.

Somewhat inspired by Dave Taylor's "Work the Shell" columns
in the Feb/Mar(&Apr?) 2015 issues of Linux Journal.

Not really intended for public consumption - mostly just for
my own amusement... but if you find anything interesting,
have at it!! :-)

Requires at least perl v5.10

### Module dependencies:
* Find::Bin
* Pod::Usage
* Moose
* MooseX::NonMoose
* Games::Cards
* IO::Prompter
* Term::ANSIColor
* Test::Most (only if you want to run the tests)
